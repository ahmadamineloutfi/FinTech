      "abstract   based on a systematic review of influential publications among 402 papers published between  2010 and 2018  this paper identifies gaps in economics and finance research regarding two  applications of fintech  crowdfunding and blockchain. analysing these reco rds shows that  i   current research on fintech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding   ii  crowdfunding  and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial  intermediation but in different ways   iii  crowdfun ding platforms substitute for traditional financial  intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary  without eliminating the need for intermediation    iv  similar to crowdfunding  blockchain also creates new intermediaries  and  v  the trust element  inheren t in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some  financial areas but not all.   introduction    solutions. the term fintech can be traced   back to the early 1990s  hochstein    2015     however  the sector has only recently attracted the focused attention of regulators  industry  participants  cons umers and academics due to its rapid alteration of traditional financial  services. global investment in financial technology increased by more than 2 200 percent  from  930   million in 2008 to more than  22   billion in 2015 1     further nearly doubling to  more than  40 billion in 2017  accenture    2017  . 2   financial institutions are embracing the  disruptive nature of fintech  and it is necessary for the academic community to be i nformed  of the significance of this revolution  to reconsider the role of finance intermediation  and to  make contributions to the birth of a new era for the financial industry.   although the term fintech is relatively new  financial innovation has a long h istory. it is  widely accepted that technology has always played a key role in the financial sector  but it is     years of     et   al .   2016   illustrate the evolution of fintech through three major eras   fintech 1.0  1866  1967   fintech 2.0  1967  2008   and fintech 3.0  2008  present . the  authors argue that the advent o f the first transatlantic cable in 1866 allowed the initial  combination of finance and technology  culminating in the first period of financial  globalisation. driven by smartphone and application programming interfaces  apis  and  further catalysed by the 2 008 global financial crisis  gfc   we are currently in stage 3.0 of  fintech in developed countries and fintech 3.5 in emerging markets. this paper further  argues that the critical difference in fintech 3.0 lies in who is providing financial services  and th e speed of development. examples in fintech 3.0 are wealthfront in 2008  which  provides online automated investment services  kickstarter in 2009  which introduces the   mo bile payments solutions. in emerging markets in asia and africa  fintech 3.5 examples   the year of 2010 and new payment banks such as fino paytech in india.    in another pa  fund of santander group  oliver wyman and anthemis group claim fintech 2.0 is capable   3   categorises  fintech into two phases. fintech phase 1 refers to the emergence of technology aimed  primarily at digitising the customer experience a nd moving services online. examples are  online trading and lending and mobile payments with little participation by the banks.  fintech phase 2.0 is being driven by artificial intelligence  ai  and greater computing power  with more collaboration and partici  similarly  philippon   2016   lists examples of fintech innovations such as cryptocurrencies  and bl ockchain  new digital advisory and trading systems  artificial intelligence  ai  and   systems.   combining different views of the origin and stages of fintech  this paper foc uses on the  contemporary two main fintech innovations that have emerged in the past 10   years    finance industry  social media and academic research  our understanding of  its applications  and impacts is quite limited. the main purpose of this paper is to provide a better  understanding of fintech by identifying the development of knowledge and gaps in relevant     as guidance  this paper  identifies publications on fintech in economics and finance research and their  interrelations. this paper therefore provides a comprehensive review of literature pertaining  to crowdfunding and blockchain. this paper reveals that  i   research on fintech and fintech  innovations is in their infancy  and with the exception of crowdfunding studies  other  fintech papers are fragmented with rare interrelations   ii  crowdfunding and blockchain can  be regarded as two innovations that may di srupt traditional financial intermediation but in  different ways   iii  crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries  and serve as a new intermediary  without eliminating the need for intermediation   iv  similar  to crowdfundin g  blockchain also creates new intermediaries  and  v  the trust element  inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some  financial areas but not all. this paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities and  pat hways for future research on fintech in economics and finance studies.   methodology  mapping fintech in economics  and finance research   this review utilises bibliographic mapping  which is an established approach for reviewing a  field of research and its inf luential

janssen   et   al .   2006   and janssen   2007  . the first step is  the compilation of a comprehensive data set of relevant publications and their citation records   i.e. a full record of their

for inclusion in this review were identified through boolean searches within the  social sciences citation index  an online academic citation database within the clarivate   thin this database  a search was initially conducted   was included as a wildcard symbol to search for variations of the term. the search identified  111 records  a    ral  insights regarding fintech. as the term fintech itself is fairly recent  we further expand our  research by including the main fintech innovations for the last 10 decades  crowdfunding  and blockchain. an advanced search then was conducted to include the     refined in the research area of business economics business finance. the advanced search  identified a further 421 records 4   . the 421 records were downloaded and imported into   abstract and k eywords of each record  and  if necessary  referring to the full text of the  publication to determine its suitability for inclusion in the review. for example  cameron    2016  technology on the consumption of music. two papers that meet our selection criteria are also  deleted from the data due to inaccessibility from the web of   ge   et   al     et   al . s  2008  paper titled     the data cleaning process  23  records were removed  leaving a total of 398 records in the data set.   the scope of this review is limited to crowdfunding and blockchain. mobile money and   or the last 10   years are  not within the scope of this review. mobile payment is growing rapidly in emerging markets  in asia and africa for the recent decade and has attracted research attention. a very brief  search suggests that and mobile payment research   is fragmented and a large amount of  research focuses on developing countries where mobile payment has been growing rapidly.   given financial systems and infrastructure in these countries are underdeveloped and have  different attributes  we exclude mobile p ayment in the scope of the review. artificial  intelligence is a broad subject that covers any technique which enables technology to mimic  human intelligence using logic  altus    2018  . the artificial intelligence technology is still in  its primitive stage  and the artificial intelligence applications in finance arrears are  immaterial. current business research is not covering artificial intelligence in detail    therefore  we also exclude it in the scope of this review.   manual additions to the data set   to check whether any records were inadvertently overlooked  a cited reference search was   t the search  criteria. in addition  restricting the search to the field of business and management may have   four additional publications were manually added to the fina l data set  see table   1  . with the  manual additions  the final data set contains 402 records published between 2010 and 2018       added in our data as they are not in the field of business  for example  the book    comprehensive introduction to the blockchain revolution  yet it is categorised in the field of  computer science.   results  citation statistics and citation map   the yearly output of research regarding fintech in the field of economics and finance is  mapped in
